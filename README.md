# Clusterous: Easy Cluster Computing with Docker and AWS
Clusterous is a easy-to-use command line tool for cluster computing on AWS. It allows you to create and manage a cluster on AWS and deploy your software in the form of Docker containers. It is aimed at scientists and researchers who want the on-demand compute power that AWS offers, but don't have the necessary time or technical expertise.

Requires Linux or OS X and Python 2.7.
